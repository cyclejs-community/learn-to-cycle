## Publishing

## Content Contributions

Any contributions you make to this effort **are of course greatly appreciated**.

However, if you choose to contribute content (not just typo corrections) to this repo, you agree that you're giving me a non-exclusive license to use that content for the book, as I (and a future publisher) deem appropriate. You probably guessed that already, but this is just to make the lawyers happy by explicitly stating it in the case I'll be able to find a publisher for this book. (Thanks to [@getify](https://twitter.com/getify) for suggesting this).

So: blah, blah, blah... :)
